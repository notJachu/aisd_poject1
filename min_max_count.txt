to implement min and max params count
make a stack of min/max counts and increment always
the topmost element
when removing element increment the new topmost by 1
incrementation should be called when ")" is read
then while stack != "(" add 1 to count
then pop min/max operation from stack and append it
to the rpn stack and increment new count if possible
